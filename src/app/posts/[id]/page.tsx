    title: "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)",
    history: "Directed by David Yates, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* introduces a more political and rebellious tone as Harry struggles with his growing responsibilities and the growing threat of Voldemort's return. In this film, Harry and his friends form 'Dumbledore's Army' to learn defense against the dark arts in secret, while the Ministry of Magic refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. The film also explores Harry's deepening connection to his past and his destiny as the one who must defeat Voldemort. The introduction of the character of Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton), the tyrannical new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, brings a new layer of conflict and tension to the story.

The film also marks a shift toward a more somber and serious tone, as the war against Voldemort escalates. With its heart-wrenching moments and a sense of inevitable loss, this film intensifies the emotional stakes and prepares the stage for the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort.",
